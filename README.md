# role-sudo

Ansible role to install and configure Sudo and Sudo-LDAP.

The role is fully generic and supports all the Sudo settings plus some more behaviours. It also supports the configuration of SUDO-LDAP, to integrate SUDO with any LDAP system and store the configuration in one central place.

The role is configured to create the default OS configuration.

## Requirements

The role requires RHEL/CentOS 7 to work.

## Role Variables

The variables are fully documented in the [default configuration](defaults/main.yml) file, including their default values and some examples. This file contains all the settings that can be configured.

Please refer to the default configuration file for the full list and use Linux man pages if you need more information on Sudo.
